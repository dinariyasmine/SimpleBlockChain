# SimpleBlockChain
![Blockchain Overview](image-1.png)

**SimpleBlockChain** is a basic blockchain implementation in C, featuring:

* **SHA-256 hashing** via OpenSSL
* **Merkle Tree** for transaction integrity
* **Block linking and validation**
* **Threaded block replication and consensus simulation**

## How It Works

* The program auto-generates a **Genesis Block** with a system transaction.
* Users add transactions (up to 10 per block).
* When a block is full or manually triggered, a **new block** is created.
* Transactions are hashed into a **Merkle Tree**, with its root hash stored in the block.
* Each block points to the hash of the previous block.
* Blockchain integrity can be verified to detect any tampering.

## User Interface

Menu-driven CLI to:

* Add transactions
* Create new blocks
* View blockchain
* Verify integrity
* Simulate attacks
* Run test cases

---

## Blockchain Security

* **Immutability**: Data once written cannot be changed undetected.
* **Integrity Verification**: Uses SHA-256 and Merkle Trees.
* **Tamper Detection**: Simulates basic attacks to show vulnerabilities.
* **Consensus Simulation**: Demonstrates basic agreement among nodes.

---

## Requirements

* GCC / Clang (C compiler)
* OpenSSL library
* POSIX-compliant OS (for threading support)

---

## Compilation

```bash
make
```

## Running

```bash
./blockchain_app
```

---

## Example Usage

1. Start the app
2. Select option 1 to add a transaction (e.g., *Yasmine sends 100 DA to Aicha*)
3. Add more transactions
4. Select option 2 to create a new block
5. Select option 3 to view blockchain
6. Select option 4 to verify chain integrity
7. Exit with option 0

---

## Additional Features

* **Test Suite**: Includes normal and malicious behavior
* **Attack Simulation**: Shows how tampering is detected
* **Consensus Simulation**: Simple peer agreement logic
* **Distributed Replication**: Simulates node-based data redundancy
